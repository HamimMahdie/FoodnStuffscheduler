Before reporting an issue, please do a search to see if it has already been reported. If you find that your issue has already been reported, you can subscribe to that report to receive updates. If you believe your issue is new, use the "New Issue" button to create a new report.

When creating an issue report, please include:
- A clear title and description of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce the problem.
- Expected behavior.
- Actual behavior.
- Screenshots if applicable.
- The version of the software you are using.

### Submitting Changes

If you're looking to submit a change, start by forking the repository and making your changes in a branch:

1. **Fork the repository**: Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository page.
2. **Clone the forked repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/[Project-Name].git
   ```
3. **Create a new branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
   ```
4. **Make your changes**: Add your changes to the branch, adhering to the coding conventions used in the project as much as possible.
5. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -am 'Add some feature'
   ```
6. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-new-branch-name
   ```
7. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to your repository on GitHub, select your branch, and click the "Pull Request" button. Provide a clear title and description of your changes.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep modifications concise. Avoid making many extensive changes in a single request.
- Write meaningful commit messages.
- Include any necessary updates to documentation or tests.
- Submit your pull request against the `main` branch.

### Code Review Process

All submissions—new features, bug fixes, and documentation changes—will go through the following review process by the repository maintainers:

1. Review the contribution for compatibility with the project's standards and guidelines.
2. Test the changes in the project environment.
3. Provide feedback or approve the changes. Feedback may require additional work or adjustments.
4. Once approved, a maintainer will merge the pull request.

## Coding Conventions

- Use spaces for indentation rather than tabs.
- Follow the naming conventions and language-specific style guidelines.
- Keep your lines of code reasonably short (e.g., under 80 characters).
- Document any public and non-trivial private methods.
